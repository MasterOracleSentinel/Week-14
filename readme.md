Working with Lists in React
------------------------------

Working with Lists in React, you’ll work through three exercises. You’ll begin by creating a To-Do list application. This will be an opportunity for you to learn how to set state in a React app and how to refactor code so you can separate the functionality into separate components. From there, you’ll learn about React Hooks, which enable you to share state logic across components. This keeps your code clean, concise, and easy to control. You’ll start using the useEffect and useState Hooks in the Rendering Lists exercises and in the Shopping Cart With Multiple Lists exercise.
